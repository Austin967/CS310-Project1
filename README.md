# CS310-Project1
Team Project 1 for Software Engineering 1

In this project, we were tasked with designing and testing a clock-in and clock-out system for a business.
We had a team size of five people with me acting as the scrum master for this project.
I was the guide between what the client (our Professor) wanted and how the team would be implementing it.
I did help write some of the code and test but was mostly acting as a team lead and scrum master and helped where I was needed.

THE PROGRAM

The program that was written so far had several steps along with custom-made tests to test if we had accounted for all variables.
The program is designed to take any number of employees' time cards and log the times and hours they worked.
